# Python with Excel

Welcome to the **Python with Excel** repository, a part of my professional portfolio focused on projects that combine the power of Python with the versatility of Excel 
for data analysis and statistical insights. This collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrate how Python can automate, enhance, and expand Excel's capabilities, making it 
a powerful tool for analyzing large data sets, performing complex statistical calculations, and generating meaningful reports.

Whether you're a data analyst, a statistician, or someone interested in leveraging Python and Excel together, this repository offers a range of projects to explore and develop.
